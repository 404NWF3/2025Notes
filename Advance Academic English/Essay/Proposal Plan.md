## Introduction & Literature Review

### Introduction

- Provide the context and set the stage for your research question in such a way as to show its necessity and importance. 
- Review relevant literature to show your ability to critically evaluate relevant literature information and to integrate and synthesize the existing literature. 
- Present the rationale of your proposed study and clearly indicate why it is worth doing. 
- State the research problem, which is often referred to as the purpose of the study. Briefly describe the major issues and sub-problems to be addressed by your research.

Generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have rapidly become both a boon and a bane in education. These language models can produce fluent essays and answers on demand, raising concerns about academic integrity in high school writing assignments. Students now have the ability to outsource their work to AI, potentially bypassing the learning process and undermining the spirit of original scholarship ([Frontiers | Investigating generative AI models and detection techniques: impacts of tokenization and dataset size on identification of AI-generated text](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1469197/full#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20such%20as%20Chat,the%20traditional%20leaning%20process%2C%20undermining)) ([Frontiers | Investigating generative AI models and detection techniques: impacts of tokenization and dataset size on identification of AI-generated text](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1469197/full#:~:text=educational%20standards,the%20accuracy%20of%20AI%20generated)). At the same time, educators recognize that such tools, if used ethically, might enhance learning by providing feedback or aiding in idea generation. This dual nature of generative AI has spurred a global conversation on how to govern its use in academics, especially in essay writing tasks that traditionally assess a student’s understanding and writing ability.  

Both English-language and Chinese academic communities are grappling with these issues. Internationally, early reactions ranged from alarm – with some school districts temporarily banning AI tools – to more measured approaches that seek to integrate AI into learning with proper guidelines ([Generative AI tools and academic integrity in schools - Evanston RoundTable](https://evanstonroundtable.com/2024/10/20/generative-ai-in-education-eths/#:~:text=The%20mad%20dash%20after%20the,the%20ban%20six%20months%20later)) ([Generative AI tools and academic integrity in schools - Evanston RoundTable](https://evanstonroundtable.com/2024/10/20/generative-ai-in-education-eths/#:~:text=The%20two%20high%20schools%20in,AI%20usage%20is%20encouraged%2Frequired)). In China, where AI technologies (including domestic ChatGPT-like models) are on the rise, educators and policymakers similarly worry about “AI代写” (AI ghostwriting) and have begun crafting policies to ensure **学术诚信** (academic integrity) is upheld. The urgency is clear: as generative AI’s capabilities continue to advance, high schools must find ways to reap its benefits for learning while mitigating the risks to fairness and honesty. This literature review examines the current landscape of governance mechanisms for generative AI in academic integrity, drawing on English sources (via Scopus-indexed literature and related reports) and Chinese sources (CNKI and educational policy documents). Key challenges, policy responses, and detection mechanisms are synthesized, and we explore analytical techniques – from corpus linguistics to deep learning – that can assist in addressing AI’s impact on high school essay writing integrity.  

### Literature Review

> [!文献综述的要点]
> 1. Challenges of Generative AI in Academic Integrity 
> 2. Governance Policies and Institutional Responses  
> 3. Corpus Analysis Techniques for AI and Writing Integrity


> 文献综述分为四个部分。
> 
> **第一部分**：综述当今时代生成式AI对学术诚信构成的挑战。要注意我们研究的方向聚焦于学术论文写作，所以一定要注意先泛谈挑战之后，最后要落脚在学术诚信地挑战上
> **第二部分**：综述政府(中国教育部)以及高校管理者(复旦、美国高校etc)的回应。我们既要强调目前管理者们已经针对问题做出了有力的回击，也要吹毛求疵提出他们的政策存在不足。比如，有些政策过于严厉，过度限制了学生使用AI辅助学习可能性；也有些政策无法与时俱进，AI的技术在不断发展，颁布者低估了AI的能力，等等（这些问题是我推测的，具体地还需要自行查阅文献）
> **第三部分**：综述研究人员针对这一问题的研究成果，包括他们的研究对象（什么地区的，什么时候的）、研究数据来源、研究方法、研究结果。
> **第四部分**：综述语料库分析的方法，指出语料库可以帮助我们挖掘目前已颁布政策的聚焦的核心，展现语料库分析的可行性

## Research objectives & questions

Our research is guided by two primary questions:

1. What are the challenges in upholding academic integrity in essay writing, particularly with the use of generative AI?
- Sub-questions include tracing the evolution of integrity issues, exploring attitudes of students and scholars, analyzing AI understanding and acceptance, and addressing AI hallucinations.
2. How do governance frameworks for upholding academic integrity in essay writing with AI compare across universities, and what improvements can be proposed?
- This involves compiling university regulations, comparing policies with scholars' expectations, and proposing enhancements.

Our project is feasible because we have designed a comprehensive methodology that includes:

- Surveys targeting student perspectives
- Interviews with academic experts
- Corpus Analysis of existing research and policy on AI in academia
- Compilation and comparison of university regulations

The practical problems we aim to solve include:

- Addressing the gap between policy and practice in AI use for academic writing
- Identifying effective approaches to maintain academic integrity without stifling innovation
- Developing guidelines that balance the benefits of AI as a learning tool while preventing misuse

Our ultimate goal is to propose an improved governance framework that educational institutions can adapt to their specific contexts, ensuring academic integrity remains protected while acknowledging the reality of AI's growing presence in education.

## Methods 

Our project is feasible because we have designed a comprehensive methodology that includes:

- Surveys targeting student perspectives
- Interviews with academic experts
- Corpus Analysis of existing research and policy on AI in academia
- Compilation and comparison of university regulations

---
## Significance and implications

The necessity of our research is evident in three key areas:

1. The widespread adoption of AI tools by students, often without clear guidance.
2. The inconsistent policies across institutions creating confusion for students and educators.
