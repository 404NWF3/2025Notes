Good day, professors and fellow students. As the project leader, I am pleased to introduce our research focusing on the intersection of generative AI and academic integrity in essay writing.

In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, AI tools like ChatGPT are transforming how students approach writing assignments. This transformation brings both opportunities and significant challenges to academic integrity frameworks. Our project aims to address this pressing issue by comparing governance approaches across universities and proposing effective solutions.

The necessity of our research is evident in three key areas:

1. The widespread adoption of AI tools by students, often without clear guidance.
2. The inconsistent policies across institutions creating confusion for students and educators.
3. The "AI hallucination" problem, where AI generates false information that can undermine academic value, but the only way to solve this is to enhance the responsibility of essay writers. 

Our research is guided by two primary questions:

1. What are the challenges in upholding academic integrity in essay writing, particularly with the use of generative AI?
- Sub-questions include tracing the evolution of integrity issues, exploring attitudes of students and scholars, analyzing AI understanding and acceptance, and addressing AI hallucinations.
2. How do governance frameworks for upholding academic integrity in essay writing with AI compare across universities, and what improvements can be proposed?
- This involves compiling university regulations, comparing policies with scholars' expectations, and proposing enhancements.

Our project is feasible because we have designed a comprehensive methodology that includes:

- Surveys targeting student perspectives
- Interviews with academic experts
- Corpus Analysis of existing research and policy on AI in academia
- Compilation and comparison of university regulations

The practical problems we aim to solve include:

- Addressing the gap between policy and practice in AI use for academic writing
- Identifying effective approaches to maintain academic integrity without stifling innovation
- Developing guidelines that balance the benefits of AI as a learning tool while preventing misuse

Our ultimate goal is to propose an improved governance framework that educational institutions can adapt to their specific contexts, ensuring academic integrity remains protected while acknowledging the reality of AI's growing presence in education.

Thank you for your attention. We welcome any questions or insights you might have.

各位教授、同学们，大家好。作为项目负责人，我很高兴向大家介绍我们关于生成式人工智能与学术写作诚信治理框架的比较研究。

在当今快速发展的教育环境中，ChatGPT等人工智能工具正在改变学生撰写作业的方式。这种转变为学术诚信框架带来了机遇和重大挑战。我们的项目旨在通过比较不同大学的治理方法并提出有效解决方案来解决这一紧迫问题。

我们研究的必要性体现在三个关键方面：

1. 学生广泛采用人工智能工具，但往往缺乏明确指导
2. 各机构政策不一致，给学生和教育者造成困惑
3. "人工智能幻觉"问题，即人工智能生成的虚假信息可能破坏学术严谨性

我们的项目具有可行性，因为我们设计了全面的研究方法，包括：

- 针对学生观点的调查
- 与学术专家的访谈
- 分析关于人工智能在学术领域应用的现有研究
- 收集和比较大学规章制度

我们旨在解决的实际问题包括：

- 确定维护学术诚信而不扼杀创新的有效方法
- 解决人工智能用于学术写作的政策与实践之间的差距
- 制定平衡人工智能作为学习工具的优势同时防止滥用的指导方针

我们的最终目标是提出一个改进的治理框架，教育机构可以根据其特定环境进行调整，确保学术诚信得到保护，同时承认人工智能在教育中日益增长的存在。

谢谢大家的关注。我们欢迎任何问题或见解。
