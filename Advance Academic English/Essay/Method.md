This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining a corpus-based analysis of institutional policies and academic literature with a survey assessing student perceptions regarding the use of Generative AI (GAI) in academic writing.

#### 1. Corpus-Based Policy and Literature Analysis

**Objective:** To identify the primary concerns and regulatory approaches of higher education institutions and researchers regarding GAI in the context of academic integrity.

**Data Collection:**
*   **Institutional Policies:** Official academic integrity policies or guidelines addressing GAI use, collected from the websites of the global Top 200 universities (based on the QS World University Rankings).
*   **Academic Literature:** Peer-reviewed articles published between January 2022 (post-ChatGPT release) and June 2024 in leading higher education and assessment journals (e.g., *Higher Education*, *Studies in Higher Education*, *Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education*). Search terms will include "generative AI," "academic integrity," "higher education," "policy," "assessment," etc.

**Analysis Framework:**
*   A qualitative content analysis approach will be employed using Python nltk and other libraries.
*   An initial coding framework will be developed based on existing literature and refined iteratively through the analysis process. Key analytical dimensions will include:
    *   **Regulatory Stance:** Restrictions on use (e.g., outright bans, conditional permissions), disclosure requirements (e.g., mandatory declaration of AI assistance), and consequences for misuse (e.g., penalties, disciplinary actions).
    *   **Pedagogical Integration:** Educational initiatives (e.g., AI literacy training, ethical use guidelines) and assessment adaptations (e.g., process-based assessment, AI-resistant assignments).
    *   **Ethical Considerations:** Discussions surrounding authorship, intellectual property, fairness, and the potential impact on skill development.
*   Frequency analysis of codes and thematic synthesis will be used to identify dominant themes and patterns across policies and literature.

#### 2. Student Perception Survey

**Objective:** To understand students' awareness, experiences, and acceptance levels concerning GAI use in essay writing and the associated institutional regulations.

**Questionnaire Design:**
The survey instrument will comprise the following sections:
*   **Demographics:** Collect background information such as field of study (e.g., Humanities, STEM, Social Sciences), year of study, and self-reported frequency and nature of GAI tool usage for academic purposes.
*   **Awareness and Experience:**
    *   Familiarity with their institution's specific policies on GAI use (using Likert scales, e.g., 1=Not at all familiar, 5=Very familiar).
    *   Perceived impact of GAI on their learning and writing processes (multiple-choice or Likert scale questions).
    *   Recognition of potential academic integrity risks associated with GAI (e.g., plagiarism, over-reliance, stifling critical thinking) (multiple-choice questions).
*   **Acceptance and Attitudes:**
    *   Level of agreement with different potential regulatory approaches (e.g., complete ban, mandatory disclosure, permitted use with guidelines) (Likert scales).
    *   Perceived fairness and effectiveness of current or proposed institutional rules.
    *   Preferences for institutional support regarding GAI use (e.g., workshops, clear guidelines, access to detection tools) (ranking or multiple-choice questions).

**Sampling Strategy:**
*   **Target Population:** Undergraduate and postgraduate students across diverse disciplines.
*   **Sampling Method:** Stratified sampling will be considered, potentially targeting students from different types of institutions (e.g., research-intensive, teaching-focused) or different faculties within a single institution to ensure diverse perspectives.
*   **Sample Size:** Determined using power analysis (e.g., G*Power) to ensure sufficient statistical power for planned analyses, aiming for a minimum number of valid responses per stratum (e.g., >200 per targeted institutional type or faculty).

**Procedure and Validation:**
*   The questionnaire will be reviewed by experts in educational assessment and survey design for content validity.
*   A pilot test (nâ‰ˆ30-50 students) will be conducted to identify ambiguous questions and refine the instrument.
*   Ethical approval will be sought from the relevant institutional review board. Participation will be voluntary, and anonymity/confidentiality will be ensured.
*   Data will be collected via an online survey platform.

**Data Analysis:**
*   Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, standard deviations) will be used to summarize student demographics, awareness levels, and general attitudes.
*   Inferential statistics (e.g., t-tests, ANOVAs, chi-square tests) will be employed to explore potential differences in perceptions based on demographics (e.g., discipline, GAI usage experience).
*   Correlation analysis may be used to examine relationships between awareness, usage patterns, and acceptance levels.

#### 3. Triangulation

The findings from the corpus analysis (institutional/researcher perspectives) and the student survey (student perspectives) will be triangulated. This involves comparing and contrasting the identified policy themes with student awareness and acceptance levels to identify potential gaps, convergences, and divergences between policy intentions and student realities. This synthesis will inform the development of recommendations for more effective and balanced governance frameworks.
