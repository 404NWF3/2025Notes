I am going to participating in a stastic modeling competition. I want to conduct a reasearch named  "Analysis and Prediction of Consumer loyalty Driven by Data from Social Media". Following are my plan:

"""
a. Background: The dissmennation of social media have provided diversed data resource, and brand loyalty is a significant index enterprise focusing on.
b. Data Source: The comment, thumbs-up and sharing from social media.
c. Research: Scratch data from social media; Extract consumer rating information through text mining, sentiment analysis; Construct a statistic model to analysis the influencing factor of brand loyalty; Predict the trending of brand loyalty.
"""

Now, I want you to help me optimize my thesis topic, considering that I have only 1-2 months to prepare and research; retriave and syntesis literature for me to deepen my understanding to the thesis; enlight the research method, especially python code for data scratch, mathematic, deep learning, stastic model and code for analysis and predict of brand loyalty.

I am going to conduct a reserach on "The Challenges and Governance Mechanisms of Academic Integrity in the Age of Artificial Intelligence". As we all know, the development of Generative Artificial Intelligence(GAI) is rapid, but the corresponding policies and governance mechanisms is falling behind. So, it's necessary to review the previous researches on the governance of GAI, and launch a new method, even model to manipulate the usage of GAI.Following are my plans:
"""
a. Background: The GAI is developing rapidly, which has posed great challenges to the academic landscope, especially essay writing. There is no comprehensive governances for GAI usage. The governance of GAI in different regions is not synchronous. A comprehensive governance is crucial to guide the students to use GAI correctly.
b. Data Source: Thesises in the essay database, the regulation files that high schools have launched.
c. Quantitative Linguistic: Analysize a large amount of essays on this topic, using corpus linguistic method to analysis the articles.
d. Conclusion: Through complete analysis, we will get the challenges of GAI usage, and we will targettedly find a method to regulate the misuse and misconduct od GAI use
"""

Now, I want you to help me optimize my thesis topic, considering that I have only 2-3 months to prepare and research; retriave and syntesis literature for me to deepen my understanding to the thesis; enlight the research method, especially python code for article retriave, quantified linguistic analysis, conclusions based on corpus linguistic principle.
